Modern applications are updated frequently. Each new update can unknowingly weaken stability or recovery behavior even if individual tests pass.

Traditional testing checks whether features work, but not how the system behaves under stress or during partial failures. As a result, hidden dependencies or bottlenecks often appear only after users are affected.

Systems are often tested in ideal conditions, but real-world environments are unpredictable â€” components can fail, networks can slow down, or configurations may break without warning.
