chaos engineering / fault injection frameworks and tools—open source and commercial

Major Chaos Frameworks & Tools
Name	Open / Commercial	Target / Environment	Strengths / Use Cases	Notes / Considerations
LitmusChaos	Open source (CNCF)	Kubernetes / cloud-native	Experiment orchestration using CRDs, probes, ChaosHub, integrated with Prometheus / Grafana 
LitmusChaos
	Good fit if you want declarative chaos and Kubernetes-native workflows
Chaos Mesh	Open source	Kubernetes	Rich fault types (pod, network, I/O, node-level), Kubernetes custom resources 
Chaos Mesh
	Very common in cloud-native stacks
Chaos Toolkit	Open source	Generic / hybrid	“Chaos as code” approach; experiments as JSON/YAML; highly extensible 
Chaos Toolkit
	Good for integrations, multi-platform targeting
Chaos Monkey	Open source	VM / instance-level (cloud)	Randomly terminates instances to test resilience 
Netflix Open Source Software

	Originally from Netflix; simple but limited scope
Pumba	Open source	Docker / container networking	Network emulation, fault injection in containers 
Container Solutions Blog
+1
	Useful for lower-level network faults in container contexts
ChaosBlade	Open source (Alibaba)	Hosts / containers / Kubernetes	CPU, memory, disk, network faults injection 
Steadybit
	CLI-first, lightweight faults
ToxiProxy	Open source	Network / proxy-level	Latency, packet loss, bandwidth shaping capabilities 
Steadybit
	Works well as a supporting tool (especially for microservice networking)
Gremlin	Commercial	Multi-environment (cloud, containers, VMs)	Feature-rich UI, safety controls, broad fault library 
Gremlin

	Great if your infra is mostly on AWS
Azure Chaos Studio	Commercial / Azure-managed	Azure cloud	Fault injection for Azure resources, service-level faults 
Gremlin
+2
Speedscale
+2
	Best when using Microsoft / Azure ecosystem
Steadybit	Commercial	Hybrid / cloud-native	Drag-and-drop experiment builder, reliability policies 
Steadybit
	More accessible for organizations wanting built-in tooling
